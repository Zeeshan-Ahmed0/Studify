Studify is a simple and engaging educational app designed to help users learn in a structured way. First, users choose a subject theyâ€™re interested in, like Math, Science, or History. Once they've picked a subject, they can select a specific topic within that subject, such as "Fractions" in Math or "Photosynthesis" in Science. The app then provides a clear, easy-to-follow explanation of the topic, making it simple to understand. After the explanation, users can take quizzes or do exercises to test what they've learned and check their progress. This way, Studify helps users learn step by step, making studying fun, interactive, and effective.
